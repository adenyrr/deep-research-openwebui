This script performs advanced AI research and returns a comprehensive research report that cites its sources and verifies those citations. 

After the user enters a query, the script generates a handful of starter searches, then drafts a research outline for user review. User feedback is not only used to revise the outline, but the user preferences expressed through this feedback are used to shape the continued direction of research. After performing follow-up searches to revise the outline, iterative research begins, tracking the research outline from cycle to cycle, monitoring the completion of topics, and semantically determining which topics to pursue next. Repeat search results are managed variously with sliding content windows, progressive truncation, and relevance penalties, balancing an aim to limit repetition with milking the particularly-relevant repeats. After the research list is sufficiently addressed, or the max cycle limit is hit, long results are semantically compressed and a final outline is generated to refocus on the original query. The report is then generated per-subsection, combined into sections, edited per-section, combined into a final report, and globally edited. After an abstract/introduction/conclusion are generated, the final report is returned. Research results are saved as a text file to your home directory as well. Note that this all means it takes a while - this isn't a 2-minute Grok or 5-minute ChatGPT research process, it's a 30-60 minute process depending on length, and that's the biggest downside. You can't have good, cheap, *and* fast, though :)

# Forever Chemicals: A Comprehensive Assessment of PFAS Regulations, Risks, and Remediation

## Navigating the Evolving Regulatory Landscape, Addressing Human and Environmental Impacts, and Charting Future Directions

## Abstract

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a widespread and persistent environmental and public health challenge due to their unique chemical properties and extensive historical use. This report synthesizes current understanding of PFAS sources, environmental fate, health impacts, and evolving regulatory responses within the United States. PFAS persist in the environment due to strong carbon-fluorine bonds, facilitating long-range transport and bioaccumulation. Exposure pathways include drinking water, food, and air, impacting nearly all individuals, with developing fetuses and children identified as particularly vulnerable populations. Recent regulatory action includes the establishment of national drinking water standards, amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act requiring comprehensive data reporting, and the designation of PFOA/PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, prompting both increased enforcement and legal challenges. State-level regulations are expanding, creating a complex landscape for manufacturers and highlighting the need for regulatory harmonization. While granular activated carbon and ion exchange remain common remediation strategies, emerging technologies like advanced oxidation processes offer potential improvements, albeit at varying costs. Ongoing research and evolving regulatory frameworks emphasize the need for continued innovation, standardized testing, and collaborative data sharing to effectively address the pervasive issue of PFAS contamination and protect public health.

## Introduction

This report details the current state of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) regulations in the United States. Driven by growing awareness of their persistence and potential health impacts, both federal and state entities are developing increasingly comprehensive regulatory frameworks. This report begins by outlining the characteristics and sources of PFAS, alongside their documented impacts on human health and the environment. It then details the evolving federal regulatory landscape, including actions taken under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). A key focus is the proliferation of state-level regulations restricting PFAS in consumer products and addressing contamination, alongside the legal challenges and constitutional considerations arising from these efforts. Finally, this report examines current and emerging remediation technologies, funding mechanisms, and ongoing research initiatives aimed at mitigating PFAS contamination and informing future regulatory decisions. This synthesis provides a comprehensive overview of the complex and dynamic regulatory environment surrounding PFAS in the United States.

## PFAS Characteristics and Sources

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are characterized by strong carbon-fluorine bonds, which contribute to their remarkable persistence in the environment and resistance to degradation [7]. This chemical stability is the foundational property driving their widespread use in numerous industrial and consumer applications, but also the root cause of their environmental concerns [7]. The carbon-fluorine bond is among the strongest chemical bonds in organic chemistry, making PFAS exceptionally resistant to typical environmental breakdown processes like hydrolysis, photolysis, and biodegradation [7]. This inherent stability allows PFAS to persist for extended periods in water, soil, and air, earning them the designation of “forever chemicals” [7]. 

The persistence of PFAS is further compounded by their varying molecular structures and properties [7]. While some PFAS compounds degrade more readily than others, the vast majority exhibit significant resistance to environmental breakdown [7]. This resistance is not limited to the parent compounds; PFAS can also transform into other persistent fluorinated compounds, further complicating remediation efforts [7]. Moreover, PFAS exhibit high mobility in the environment, allowing them to travel long distances through air and water, contaminating remote locations [7]. This combination of persistence and mobility contributes to their widespread presence in the environment and bioaccumulation in living organisms. The chemical properties of PFAS also dictate their behavior in various environmental media [7]. Their amphiphilic nature – possessing both water-repelling and water-attracting properties – contributes to their presence in both aqueous and non-aqueous phases, and facilitates their transport through soil and groundwater [7]. Moreover, PFAS can partition into organic matter, further enhancing their persistence in sediments and soils [7]. Understanding these chemical characteristics and how they influence environmental fate is critical for developing effective strategies to mitigate PFAS contamination and protect human health [7].

The history of PFAS use has significantly contributed to their current environmental presence. Beginning in the 1940s, PFAS were incorporated into a wide array of consumer and industrial products due to their unique properties, including resistance to heat, water, and oil [7]. Consequently, PFAS have been released into the environment through manufacturing processes, industrial discharges, and the everyday use and disposal of consumer goods [7]. Specific sources contributing to environmental contamination include facilities using PFAS in production, airports and military installations utilizing PFAS-containing firefighting foams, and wastewater treatment plants [7]. Notably, firefighting foams, specifically aqueous film-forming foams (AFFF), have become a significant source of PFAS contamination due to their widespread use in training exercises and emergency response [7]. 

The environmental fate of PFAS is complex, contributing to their persistence and widespread detection. Due to their chemical stability, PFAS do not readily degrade in the environment, and are often referred to as "forever chemicals” [7]. This stability allows them to be transported long distances through air and water, leading to contamination of remote areas [7]. Furthermore, PFAS can leach from contaminated sites into groundwater, posing a long-term threat to drinking water sources [7]. The mobility of these compounds also means they can accumulate in soil and sediment, affecting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems [7]. Beyond direct releases from specific sources, numerous consumer products contain PFAS, contributing significantly to environmental exposure [7]. These substances are commonly found in non-stick cookware, waterproof clothing, food packaging, and personal care products [7]. The widespread use of these products leads to PFAS entering the environment through everyday disposal, washing, and product wear [7]. 

Industrial discharge, runoff from landfills, the use of consumer products, and AFFF release have all resulted in widespread PFAS contamination of water, soil, and air [7]. This pervasive contamination necessitates ongoing monitoring and remediation efforts, as well as the development of alternative, safer materials [7]. Ongoing efforts focus on expanding analytical methods to detect a broader range of PFAS in various environmental media, including soil, water, and air [7]. This increased monitoring, coupled with source identification and risk assessment, is vital for protecting human health and the environment from the adverse effects of these persistent chemicals [7].





## Human Health and Environmental Impacts

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) elicit a range of adverse health outcomes through several established and emerging toxicological mechanisms. A primary concern centers on PFAS’s ability to accumulate in the body due to their strong carbon-fluorine bonds, resisting typical metabolic breakdown [1]. This bioaccumulation, particularly in the blood and organs, leads to chronic exposure even from low-level environmental sources [1]. Several mechanisms contribute to the observed toxicity, including disruption of cellular metabolism, interference with hormone signaling, and immune dysfunction [8]. Specifically, PFAS can activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), leading to altered lipid metabolism and potential liver damage [8]. 

The disruption of hormonal pathways is a key mechanism linking PFAS exposure to various health effects. PFAS can bind to and interfere with the transport of hormones like thyroid hormone and cholesterol, impacting critical developmental and metabolic processes [8]. This interference is associated with observed outcomes such as altered lipid profiles, immune suppression, and decreased vaccine response in children [8]. Furthermore, PFAS exposure has been linked to reproductive effects, including decreased fertility and pregnancy-induced hypertension [8]. The observed impacts on immune function, including altered antibody production, contribute to increased susceptibility to infections and reduced vaccine efficacy [8]. Exposure to PFAS is linked to a growing list of adverse health outcomes, including certain cancers (kidney, testicular), increased cholesterol levels, thyroid disease, and ulcerative colitis [8]. While the precise mechanisms underlying these associations are still being investigated, current evidence suggests that PFAS-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and disruption of cellular signaling pathways play significant roles [8]. The EPA is actively conducting research to understand the full extent of PFAS toxicity and to develop appropriate regulatory standards to protect public health [1]. 

Multiple exposure pathways contribute to PFAS presence in human populations, with drinking water being a significant source [1, 3]. PFAS enter water systems through industrial discharges, firefighting foam use (AFFF), and leaching from contaminated sites [1, 3]. Exposure isn't limited to water; PFAS are also found in food sources, including fish that accumulate the chemicals, and through consumption of food packaged with PFAS-containing materials [8, 3]. Air deposition also contributes, introducing PFAS through inhalation and subsequent deposition onto soil and water [1]. These widespread pathways result in nearly all people in the U.S. having detectable levels of PFAS in their blood [8].  

Certain populations are considered particularly vulnerable to the adverse health effects of PFAS exposure. Developing fetuses and infants are at increased risk due to the potential for PFAS to interfere with normal development [8]. Studies indicate potential links between PFAS exposure during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes, including decreased birth weight and immune system effects [8]. Children are also considered more vulnerable due to their ongoing development and potentially higher exposure relative to body weight [8]. Additionally, individuals occupationally exposed through firefighting or industrial work face increased risk [1]. Understanding these exposure pathways and identifying vulnerable populations is crucial for effective mitigation strategies [1]. 

The environmental fate and transport of PFAS are complex processes governed by the unique physicochemical properties of these compounds and environmental conditions [1]. Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), particularly those with shorter carbon chains, exhibit high water solubility and limited sorption to soil organic matter, promoting their mobility in aquatic systems and groundwater [11]. While some PFAS can adsorb to solids, particularly in soils with higher organic carbon content, this adsorption is often non-linear and can be influenced by factors like pH and ionic strength [14]. Atmospheric transport also plays a significant role, with both gaseous and particulate-bound PFAS contributing to long-range deposition and widespread distribution, even to remote regions [12]. The presence of volatile precursors allows for atmospheric dissemination, subsequently transforming into PFAAs through degradation processes [14].  

Beyond transport, the persistence of PFAS in the environment is a major concern. PFAAs are highly resistant to both abiotic and biotic degradation, contributing to their long-term presence in various environmental media [1]. However, some polyfluorinated precursors can undergo transformation, often resulting in the formation of PFAAs, although the extent of this transformation varies depending on the specific precursor and environmental conditions [14]. The interplay between transport and transformation processes dictates the ultimate fate of PFAS, influencing their distribution and potential for exposure [1]. 

Bioaccumulation of PFAS in both terrestrial and aquatic organisms is a growing area of concern [11]. While the bioaccumulation potential varies depending on the specific PFAS compound, some compounds can accumulate in tissues, potentially leading to biomagnification through the food web [11]. This poses risks to wildlife and potentially humans through consumption of contaminated food sources [11]. Understanding the factors influencing bioaccumulation, alongside transport and fate processes, is crucial for comprehensive risk assessment and the development of effective mitigation strategies [11]. Ongoing research aims to refine understanding of exposure sources, quantify health risks, and develop targeted interventions to protect public health [1, 8]. Prioritizing efforts to reduce PFAS levels in drinking water, minimize environmental releases, and inform vulnerable populations about potential risks is essential to address this widespread contamination issue [1].

## Federal Regulatory Framework in the United States

The EPA has undertaken a multi-faceted approach to address PFAS contamination, initially focusing on understanding the scope of the problem and initiating regulatory action. A key milestone was the finalization of a nationwide, legally enforceable drinking water standard for six PFAS in April 2024, establishing Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for PFOA and PFOS, alongside MCLs for four other PFAS when combined [22]. Funding is also being allocated to help states and territories achieve compliance with these new standards [22]. Prior to this, the agency issued health advisories for PFBS and GenX chemicals in June 2022, and published national recommended ambient water quality criteria for PFAS in late 2024 [22]. Further monitoring of drinking water systems was initiated through the Fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR), requiring roughly 10,000 public water systems to report data for 29 PFAS chemicals, with reporting expected to be complete in 2026 [22]. This data collection aims to inform future regulatory decisions and provide a comprehensive understanding of PFAS occurrence nationwide [22]. Ongoing research and monitoring efforts are also underway to better characterize potential health impacts from a wider range of PFAS and to inform future regulatory actions [22]. 

To enhance its understanding of PFAS production and use, the EPA recently amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), most notably through Section 8(a)(7) [21]. This rule mandates that manufacturers – including importers – report data on PFAS chemicals, encompassing both those currently and historically produced, to better understand their sources, uses, and potential hazards [5]. The rule applies to substances manufactured or imported since January 1, 2011, requiring comprehensive data submission on chemical identity, production volumes, uses, byproduct formation, exposure potential, and environmental/health effects [21]. Notably, the EPA chose a structural definition of PFAS, rather than listing specific chemicals, to ensure broad coverage and capture emerging compounds [20]. The scope of reporting extends beyond direct manufacturing to include importers and even those who incidentally produce PFAS as byproducts during other processes [20]. While the rule initially presented challenges due to the expansive data requirements and the need for specialized analytical capabilities, the EPA has attempted to streamline the process, offering a simplified reporting option for article importers [20]. Acknowledging these complexities, the EPA extended the initial reporting deadline to January 11, 2026 [5].

Beyond data collection and regulatory determinations, the EPA has also leveraged the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) to broaden its enforcement authority [23]. The recent designation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) as hazardous substances unlocks the full range of CERCLA tools, allowing EPA to compel responsible parties (PRPs) to address contamination or to recover agency costs for cleanup actions [23]. While concerns exist regarding broad liability given the widespread presence of these chemicals, EPA clarified its enforcement focus will prioritize “significant” contributors of PFAS to the environment, excluding entities like community water systems and publicly owned treatment works [23]. To address concerns about potentially overbroad liability, EPA issued enforcement guidance focusing on significant contributors, but the potential for litigation remains, particularly regarding the definition of “significant” and the allocation of responsibility among multiple PRPs [23]. This designation triggers reporting requirements under CERCLA sections 103 and 111(g) for releases exceeding one pound of PFOA or PFOS, as well as requirements for federal agencies transferring real estate to provide notification of PFAS presence [23]. This increased reporting and potential liability are expected to drive more proactive investigation and remediation efforts at contaminated sites [23].

These regulatory actions are coupled with ongoing enforcement strategies, prioritizing collaboration with state and local authorities, and utilizing federal authorities when necessary, particularly where state or local responses are insufficient [22]. The EPA also intends to actively support communities impacted by PFAS releases through federal enforcement tools and to provide consistent communication and guidance to the public regarding the risks associated with PFAS exposure [22]. Expanding analytical capabilities and data collection remains a priority, including expanding existing drinking water methods to include GenX chemicals and additional PFAS, as well as developing new methods for a broader range of PFAS in various media like soil, air, and water [22]. Furthermore, the agency has initiated efforts to create a standardized data inventory and best practices for sharing PFAS monitoring data, aiming to improve access and facilitate informed decision-making by stakeholders [22]. These actions, combined with long-term research and monitoring, aim to comprehensively address PFAS contamination across various media and ensure greater accountability for those responsible [23].

## State Regulations, Legal Challenges, and Future Directions

Driven by increasing awareness of the health and environmental risks posed by PFAS, U.S. states are proactively implementing regulations to address these substances in consumer products and the environment [10]. Several states have adopted legislation restricting PFAS in various sectors, particularly textiles and apparel. For instance, New York’s regulations, effective January 1, 2025, prohibit the sale of apparel containing intentionally added PFAS, with a later date for outdoor apparel designed for severe wet conditions [10]. California's AB 1817, also taking effect January 1, 2025, similarly restricts intentionally added PFAS in textiles and a range of other consumer goods [10, 4]. These regulations often necessitate compliance testing, with the Afirm Group recommending testing methodologies like EN 14582:2016 (modified) for total fluorine content [10]. Beyond specific product bans, states are also establishing frameworks for enforcement and liability. California’s AB 347 assigns oversight authority to the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) to strengthen enforcement of existing PFAS restrictions [4]. Additionally, states like Minnesota and Vermont are developing reporting requirements for products containing PFAS, aiming to enhance transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain [10]. Vermont’s pending legislation focuses on products with recycled content, while Minnesota is preparing for beta testing of its PFAS reporting system in 2025 [10].

The expansion of PFAS regulations at both the state and federal levels is increasingly prompting questions regarding constitutional challenges and federal preemption. Several states have enacted legislation restricting PFAS in products, leading to concerns from manufacturers about potential violations of the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce [10]. These challenges typically center on arguments that state-level restrictions unduly burden interstate commerce by creating a patchwork of regulations that complicate supply chains and increase costs [10]. However, courts have generally upheld state regulations when they address legitimate local concerns, such as public health and environmental protection, and do not excessively burden interstate commerce [10]. Federal actions, particularly the designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA, also present preemption considerations. While CERCLA itself does not explicitly preempt state laws, conflicts can arise if state regulations are inconsistent with or more lenient than federal requirements [12]. The EPA’s enforcement discretion policy aims to mitigate some of these conflicts by prioritizing certain responsible parties, but the potential for litigation regarding the scope of federal authority remains [12]. The debate also extends to whether federal regulations, especially those impacting manufacturing processes, could be challenged under the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause if they significantly diminish property values [12]. Manufacturers are increasingly scrutinizing state and federal actions, seeking opportunities to challenge regulations they deem overly burdensome or preempted by federal law [10]. 

Addressing PFAS contamination requires a diverse and evolving toolkit of remediation technologies, each with varying costs and effectiveness [12]. Granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration remains a common method for removing PFAS from drinking water, but these systems generate spent carbon requiring disposal, contributing to lifecycle costs [12]. Emerging technologies aim to reduce these costs and improve removal efficiencies. Ion exchange resins offer a competitive alternative to GAC, demonstrating high PFAS removal capacity, though regeneration and disposal of the saturated resin still pose challenges [12]. More innovative approaches include advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), such as using ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and UV light, which can destructively mineralize PFAS compounds, offering a potentially complete solution, but at a higher energy cost [12]. The cost of implementing these technologies varies significantly depending on PFAS concentration, the volume of water or soil to be treated, and the specific technology employed [12]. GAC and ion exchange are relatively established and offer lower upfront costs, but the recurring expenses associated with resin replacement or disposal can be substantial [12]. AOPs, while promising, often have higher initial capital investment and operational costs due to energy consumption and chemical use [12]. Emerging technologies like bioaugmentation – utilizing microorganisms to degrade PFAS – and electrochemical oxidation are under development and may offer cost-effective solutions in the future, but require further research and pilot-scale testing [12]. Recent settlements with PFAS manufacturers, such as the agreements with 3M and DuPont [12], aim to alleviate the financial burden on communities by providing funds for treatment and cleanup; however, these settlements are subject to eligibility requirements and may not cover all associated costs [12]. The total cost of addressing PFAS contamination nationwide is estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars [12], highlighting the need for continued innovation, efficient technologies, and responsible funding strategies.

Ongoing research into per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is critical for informing evolving regulatory landscapes both within the United States and internationally. Currently, significant effort is dedicated to understanding the full scope of PFAS compounds – exceeding 12,000 – and their potential health and environmental impacts [10]. This includes investigations into novel analytical methods for detection, particularly quantifying total organic fluorine as a proxy for PFAS presence, and differentiating between various PFAS compounds [2]. Harmonization of regulations remains a significant challenge, despite increasing global attention to PFAS. The European Union is pursuing broad restrictions on all PFAS under REACH and the POPs Regulation. In contrast, the U.S. approach is more fragmented, relying on a combination of federal initiatives under TSCA, SDWA, and CERCLA, alongside individual state-level regulations [2]. This patchwork creates complexity for manufacturers and importers operating across borders. Efforts to standardize testing protocols, such as those recommended by AFIRM and outlined in standards like EN ISO 23702-1 and ASTM D7359 [2], are crucial steps toward greater regulatory alignment. Collaborative research initiatives and data sharing between regulatory bodies, such as the ongoing work to validate alternative testing methods and assess the efficacy of remediation technologies [10], are essential. As research uncovers new information regarding the risks posed by PFAS and the feasibility of safer alternatives, regulatory frameworks must be continuously updated and harmonized to effectively protect public health and the environment. The development of unified compliance strategies, linking Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and Digital Product Passports, is emerging as a key component of this evolving landscape [2].

## Conclusion

The objective of this research was to comprehensively summarize the current state of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) regulations in the United States. Initial inquiry focused on characterizing PFAS – their persistence due to strong carbon-fluorine bonds, widespread presence resulting from decades of industrial and consumer use, and diverse pathways for environmental and human exposure. Research subsequently expanded to encompass federal and state regulatory responses, emerging remediation technologies, and ongoing scientific investigations into the full scope of PFAS compounds and their impacts. This synthesis demonstrates that PFAS contamination is a pervasive and complex issue demanding a multi-faceted approach.

Key discoveries reveal a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. The EPA has established legally enforceable drinking water standards for six PFAS, amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to require reporting of PFAS data, and designated PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA. Simultaneously, numerous states are enacting their own restrictions on PFAS in products like textiles, while also implementing reporting requirements to enhance supply chain transparency. This dual approach – federal standards combined with state-level initiatives – is intended to address PFAS contamination across multiple sectors and media, though it also introduces complexities regarding potential legal challenges and the need for regulatory harmonization. Current remediation technologies, including granular activated carbon, ion exchange resins, and advanced oxidation processes, offer varying degrees of effectiveness and cost, highlighting the need for continued innovation and responsible funding.

The research clearly demonstrates that PFAS are not a singular problem, but rather a class of over 12,000 compounds with varying properties and impacts. Ongoing research is critical for identifying and characterizing these emerging contaminants, understanding their health effects, and developing more effective remediation strategies. The combination of federal regulatory actions, state-level initiatives, and ongoing scientific investigations represents a significant step towards addressing PFAS contamination, but sustained effort is needed to fully mitigate the risks and protect public health and the environment. The subject is definitively characterized by a growing body of evidence detailing widespread contamination, escalating regulatory action, and continued scientific inquiry into the full scope of the problem.

While research expanded into areas such as remediation technologies and legal challenges, the central focus remained firmly on the regulatory landscape. The interplay between federal and state actions, the evolution of regulatory standards, and the ongoing scientific investigations all contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the current state of PFAS regulations in the United States. This synthesis provides a detailed overview of the existing framework, the challenges that remain, and the direction of future efforts to address this pervasive environmental issue.

## 🔧 Configuration des embeddings et streaming (exemples)

- Activer une API compatible OpenAI (ex. OpenRouter / Mistral) :

```python
p = Pipe()
p.valves.OPENAI_API_URL = "https://api.openrouter.ai/v1"
p.valves.OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk_..."
# Modèles selon votre fournisseur
p.valves.RESEARCH_MODEL = "mistral-large"
p.valves.EMBEDDING_MODEL = "text-embedding-3-large"
```

- Contrôler le batching / async des embeddings :

```python
p.valves.EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE = 1       # 1 = pas de batching
p.valves.EMBEDDING_BATCH_ASYNC = True     # exécute les batches concurrents
p.valves.EMBEDDING_BATCH_TIMEOUT = 30     # timeout par batch (s)
# Délai minimum (secondes) entre requêtes non-batch (single-item) — utile si votre fournisseur impose un rate-limit strict
p.valves.EMBEDDING_NONBATCH_RATE_LIMIT = 1.0
```

- Configurer le chunking des textes longs pour embeddings :

```python
p.valves.EMBEDDING_CHUNK_SIZE = 1200      # taille max (caractères) par chunk
p.valves.EMBEDDING_CHUNK_OVERLAP = 200    # overlap (caractères) entre chunks
```

- Exemple de streaming de complétion (OpenAI-compatible requis) :

```python
async def on_stream(partial):
    if partial is None:
        print("[STREAM DONE]")
        return
    print(partial, end="", flush=True)

await p.generate_completion(
    model=p.get_research_model(),
    messages=[{"role":"user","content":"Fais un résumé court de ceci."}],
    stream=True,
    stream_handler=on_stream
)
```

Cette configuration vous permet d'utiliser OpenRouter/Mistral pour les embeddings et la génération, de paralléliser les batches d'embeddings et de gérer le streaming des réponses en temps réel.

- Masquer les recherches pendant l'exécution (stream final seulement) :

```python
# n'affiche que la synthèse finale et les erreurs, masque les statuts et messages intermédiaires
# Les messages intermédiaires sont toujours envoyés mais marqués `masked=True` et encapsulés
# dans des balises `<think>...</think>` pour que l'interface puisse les afficher sur demande.
p.valves.STREAM_FINAL_ONLY = True
```

- Détails d'affichage :
  - Les événements ont maintenant un champ `masked: True` et le contenu est enveloppé via `<think>...</think>` lorsque `STREAM_FINAL_ONLY=True`.
  - Les erreurs (`level == "error"`) ne sont jamais masquées.

- Utilisation d'Ollama : Ollama est facultatif. Si vous fournissez `OPENAI_API_URL` (et facultativement `OPENAI_API_KEY`), l'API OpenAI-compatible sera utilisée par défaut.

- Configuration avancée par service : vous pouvez maintenant spécifier des endpoints distincts pour les embeddings et la synthèse :

```python
p.valves.EMBEDDING_API_URL = "https://api.openrouter.ai/v1"
p.valves.EMBEDDING_API_KEY = "sk_..."  # facultatif
p.valves.SYNTHESIS_API_URL = "https://api.openrouter.ai/v1"
p.valves.SYNTHESIS_API_KEY = "sk_..."  # facultatif
```

Si une option spécifique n'est pas fournie, le `OPENAI_API_URL` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` servira de fallback.

- OCR Mistral pour PDF : vous pouvez activer l'OCR Mistral pour les PDFs scannés (modèle `mistral-ocr-latest` par défaut) :

```python
p.valves.MISTRAL_OCR_ENABLED = True
p.valves.MISTRAL_API_URL = "https://mistral.ai/api/v1"
p.valves.MISTRAL_API_KEY = "sk_mistral..."  # facultatif
p.valves.MISTRAL_OCR_MODEL = "mistral-ocr-latest"
```

La fonction testera d'abord les extractions textuelles locales (PyPDF2/pdfplumber). Si ces méthodes échouent et que `MISTRAL_OCR_ENABLED=True`, le PDF sera envoyé au endpoint Mistral pour OCR. Notez que les détails d'API peuvent varier selon les fournisseurs; le client essaie plusieurs patterns d'endpoint courants.
